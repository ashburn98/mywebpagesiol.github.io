<p><strong>Universal Studios Singapore</strong> is a theme park located within Resorts World Sentosa on Sentosa Island, Singapore. It features 28 rides, shows, and attractions in seven themed zones. It was a key component of Genting's bid for the right to build Singapore's second integrated resort. On 8 December 2006, the Singapore government announced that the consortium had won the bid. Construction of the theme park and the rest of the resort started on 19 April 2007. It is the second Universal Studios theme park to open in Asia (Japan being the first), and the first in Southeast Asia. The official plans for the park were unveiled to the public when Universal Studios Singapore released a park map to the public on 20 October 2009. Universal Studios Singapore has since attracted more than 2 million visitors in the 9 months from its opening.</p>

The luge, situated on the Imbiah Lookout cluster opposite the Tiger Sky Tower, has four tracks. The tracks are called the Jungle Trail (628 metres (2,060 ft)), the Dragon Trail (688 metres (2,257 ft)), the Kupu Kupu Trail (638 meters (2,093 ft)) and the Expedition Trail (658 meters (2159 ft). The Jungle Trail is the oldest, followed by the Dragon Trail and the Kupu Kupu and Expedition trails.The luge is a self-driving car system in which riders control the speed by pushing a pair of handlebars back and forth. The luge ride goes downhill, relying on gravitational pull to move. After the ride, the 315 meter long Skyride, using chairlifts, brings riders, luge carts, and the helmets back to the starting point. The Skyride is similar to a ski lift. There are two Skyride systems available for use.</p>
